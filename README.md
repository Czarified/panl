**Panelyze** is a Python library for analyzing structural panels with cutouts, providing tools for stress analysis, geometric optimization, and design validation.

## Features

- 🔧 Structural panel analysis with cutout support
- 📊 Stress concentration calculations
- 🎯 Geometric optimization
- ✅ Comprehensive testing with pytest
- 🎨 Code quality enforced with pre-commit hooks

## Installation

### From PyPI (once published)

```bash
pip install panelyze
```

### For Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Czarified/panelyze.git
cd panelyze

# Install Poetry if you haven't already
# Visit: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Install pre-commit hooks
poetry run pre-commit install
```

## Quick Start

```python
import panelyze

# Your code here
print(f"Panelyze version: {panelyze.__version__}")
```

## Development

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Poetry**: Dependency management
- **Nox**: Task automation and testing across Python versions
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality
- **pytest**: Testing framework with coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
poetry run nox -s tests

# Run tests for specific Python version
poetry run nox -s tests-3.11
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run all linters
poetry run nox -s lint

# Format code with black
poetry run nox -s black

# Sort imports with isort
poetry run nox -s isort

# Run pre-commit hooks
poetry run nox -s pre-commit
```

### Available Nox Sessions

```bash
# List all available sessions
poetry run nox --list

# Run a specific session
poetry run nox -s <session-name>
```

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- Poetry for dependency management
